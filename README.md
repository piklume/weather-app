# Weather app for coding round

1> I have rendered the search bar and button.
2> Button is disabled if there is no text.
3> Set up redux and redux-saga.
4> Fetching the country data from the api and displaying it in card.
5> Weather dialog is implemented using redux saga api call.
6> All components are material ui.
7> API calls are in redux-saga files (country.saga.js).

I could not style the app, please excuse my horrible css, I promise to get better with styling soon. Could not put the api key in dotenv file due to time constraints, it was not fetching the key during execution so have used a tempKey variable in the saga file itself.
